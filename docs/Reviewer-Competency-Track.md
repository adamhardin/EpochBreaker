# Reviewer Competency Track

This document defines the reviewer competency track derived from the competencies listed in [GAME-DESIGN-REVIEW.md](../GAME-DESIGN-REVIEW.md). Each competency has evidence requirements, a pass threshold, and a primary assessment method.

## Critical Competencies (Directly Shapes Fun)

1. **2D Platformer Game Feel & Tuning**
   - Evidence: tuning sheet, jump arc plots, input buffering analysis, benchmark comparison notes.
   - Primary assessment: feel calibration review + blind comparison test.

2. **Destructible Environment Design**
   - Evidence: destruction traversal spec, puzzle scenarios, preserve vs. destroy decision notes, playtest observations.
   - Primary assessment: emergence and fairness rubric.

3. **Weapon System & Power Fantasy Design**
   - Evidence: power curve model, escalation plan, trivialization window analysis, balance simulations.
   - Primary assessment: power fantasy vs. difficulty balance rubric.

4. **Mobile Game UX & Touch Control Optimization**
   - Evidence: thumb reach maps, touch target audit, latency budget, usability session notes.
   - Primary assessment: ergonomics and accessibility rubric.

## High Value Competencies (Progression and Retention)

5. **Procedural Level Design & Replayability**
   - Evidence: determinism report, fairness checks, handcrafted-feel review, constraint rules.
   - Primary assessment: determinism and intentionality rubric.

6. **Difficulty Curve & Boss Encounter Design**
   - Evidence: difficulty curve graphs, spike analysis, boss phase readability tests, checkpoint pacing notes.
   - Primary assessment: pacing and clarity rubric.

7. **Scoring, Incentive & Achievement Design**
   - Evidence: scoring tradeoff model, incentive map, achievement intent matrix, player choice analysis.
   - Primary assessment: tradeoff and motivation rubric.

8. **Ethical Retention & Session Design**
   - Evidence: ethical audit checklist, session length study, daily challenge spec, opt-in analysis.
   - Primary assessment: ethics and player-respect rubric.

## Valuable Competencies (Polish and Identity)

9. **Retro / Pixel Art Aesthetic Direction**
   - Evidence: palette system, readability tests, cohesion review, code-generated art constraints.
   - Primary assessment: readability and identity rubric.

10. **Chiptune & Synthesized Audio**
    - Evidence: waveform plan, loop integrity tests, SFX recognition test, feedback timing map.
    - Primary assessment: clarity and authenticity rubric.

11. **Social/Competitive Mechanics for Single-Player**
    - Evidence: seed sharing UX test, leaderboard motivation survey, participation hypotheses.
    - Primary assessment: social value rubric.

12. **Cross-Platform Design (Mobile + Browser)**
    - Evidence: parity matrix, input translation tests, friction mapping.
    - Primary assessment: platform fit rubric.

## Mapping to Training Modules

- Module 4: Platformer feel and mechanics (supports 1, 6).
- Module 5: Mobile UX and accessibility (supports 4, 12).
- Module 6: Audio and aesthetics (supports 9, 10).
- Phase 5: Generative systems (supports 5, 11).
- Addendum modules 3A/4A/6A/7A (supports 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).

## Pass Rules

- All Critical competencies must pass.
- Overall pass requires 90%+ of competencies meeting or exceeding their thresholds.
- Evidence artifacts must be complete and auditable.
